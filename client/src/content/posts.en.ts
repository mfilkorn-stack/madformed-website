## AI as an Everyday Tool

The use of AI tools like Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT is revolutionizing work in sales – including in medical technology. But where do you start as a sales team?

### Three Practical Entry Points

**1. Email Communication**
Start with follow-up emails after customer meetings. AI helps you formulate faster while maintaining your personal style.

**2. Account Research**
Let AI summarize information about prospects: company news, personnel changes, strategic initiatives. In minutes instead of hours.

**3. Quote Preparation**
Create value argumentation and competitive analyses with AI support. The result: better-prepared meetings.

### Important: Data Protection

In the medical field, data protection is particularly important. Never enter patient data or confidential business information into AI tools. Use enterprise versions where possible.

### Our Recommendation

Start with a Kickstart workshop. In 2 hours, your team learns the basics and receives 5 use cases for immediate application.

## Two Tools, Different Strengths

Both Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT are powerful AI tools. But which is better suited for your sales team?

### Microsoft Copilot

**Strengths:**
- Seamless integration in Outlook, Teams, Word
- Access to your M365 data
- Email summaries and drafts directly in Outlook
- Meeting summaries in Teams

**Ideal for:**
- Teams fully in the Microsoft ecosystem
- Email-intensive workflows
- Existing M365 Enterprise license

### ChatGPT

**Strengths:**
- Flexible, versatile usable
- Custom GPTs for specific use cases
- Stronger in creative tasks
- Independent of infrastructure

**Ideal for:**
- Creative brainstorming sessions
- Complex prompt workflows
- Teams without M365 Enterprise

### Our Recommendation

**For beginners:** Start with ChatGPT Plus (€20/month) to learn the basics. The investment is manageable.

**For Microsoft shops:** Copilot is the natural choice if you already work with M365 Enterprise.

**Optimal setup:** Many teams use both – Copilot for day-to-day business, ChatGPT for creative challenges.

### Data Protection Reminder

Both tools process your inputs. For sensitive customer data, use the enterprise versions with stricter data processing agreements.
